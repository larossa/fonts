Staatliches is a clean cut display face with charmingly unconventional proportions. The alphabet was designed by Brian LaRossa and Erica Carras for <a href="http://www.typebrut.com/">Type Brut Foundry</a> in response to Herbert Bayer’s title lettering on the cover of the first Bauhaus exhibition <a href="https://www.moma.org/collection/works/7567?artist_id=399&locale=en&page=1&sov_referrer=artist">catalogue</a>, which was published in 1923. It features full sets of capitals, numbers, punctuation, and symbols, in addition to alternate widths, discretionary ligatures, and common Latin accents.

Founded by Brian LaRossa in 2014, Type Brut is a display-type foundry that revives art-historical letterforms. Some Type Brut display faces are reactions to early 20th century avant grade magazines, some are reactions to historically significant works of art. The alphabets have been extrapolated from a handful of letters—each display face is part revival, part invention. Type Brut is an educational experiment which embodies the belief that innovation is born from a well explored past.
